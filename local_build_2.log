w: The following Kotlin/Native targets cannot be built on this machine and are disabled:
iosArm64, iosSimulatorArm64, iosX64, watchosArm64, watchosSimulatorArm64, watchosX64
To hide this message, add 'kotlin.native.ignoreDisabledTargets=true' to the Gradle properties.

w: The Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template was not applied to 'root project 'kotlin-secure-storage'':
Explicit .dependsOn() edges were configured for the following source sets:
[iosArm64Main, iosArm64Test, iosMain, iosSimulatorArm64Main, iosSimulatorArm64Test, iosTest, iosX64Main, iosX64Test, watchosArm64Main, watchosArm64Test, watchosMain, watchosSimulatorArm64Main, watchosSimulatorArm64Test, watchosTest, watchosX64Main, watchosX64Test]

Consider removing dependsOn-calls or disabling the default template by adding
    'kotlin.mpp.applyDefaultHierarchyTemplate=false'
to your gradle.properties

WARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35

This Android Gradle plugin (8.5.2) was tested up to compileSdk = 34.

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35.

If you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 35 is available.

For more information refer to the compatibility table:
https://d.android.com/r/tools/api-level-support

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35
to this project's gradle.properties.

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':transformCommonMainDependenciesMetadata'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':commonMainResolvableDependenciesMetadata'.
   > Configuration `:allSourceSetsCompileDependenciesMetadata` contains AndroidX dependencies, but the `android.useAndroidX` property is not enabled, which may cause runtime issues.
     Set `android.useAndroidX=true` in the `gradle.properties` file and retry.
     The following AndroidX dependencies are detected:
     :allSourceSetsCompileDependenciesMetadata -> androidx.security:security-crypto:1.0.0
     :allSourceSetsCompileDependenciesMetadata -> androidx.security:security-crypto:1.0.0 -> androidx.annotation:annotation:1.1.0
